## Day 2 – Aptitude Practice (Percentages – Formula Based)

Solved formula-based percentage problems, focusing on real exam patterns such as
votes, valid–invalid votes, marks, base value, and reverse percentage.

📘 Topics Covered
🔹 1️⃣ Basic Percentage Formula
- Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100
- Value = (Percentage × Total) / 100
-Total = (Value × 100) / Percentage
- Conversion between fraction, decimal, and percentage

🔹 2️⃣ Percentage of a Quantity
- Finding a percentage of a given number
- Finding the number when its percentage is given
- Comparing quantities using percentage

🔹 3️⃣ Percentage Increase
- Increase in value = New Value − Original Value
- Percentage Increase = (Increase / Original Value) × 100
- Applications in salary, population, price rise

🔹 4️⃣ Percentage Decrease
- Decrease in value = Original Value − New Value
- Percentage Decrease = (Decrease / Original Value) × 100
- Applications in discount, loss, price reduction

🔹 5️⃣ Problems Based on Votes
- Percentage of votes secured by candidates
- Finding vote difference using percentage
- Comparison of votes between two or more candidates

🔹 6️⃣ Valid & Invalid Votes
- Percentage of valid votes
- Percentage of invalid votes
- Finding total votes when valid or invalid votes are given
- Determining winning margin using valid votes
🔹 7️⃣ Problems Based on Marks
- Percentage of marks obtained
- Finding total marks from given percentage
- Pass and fail based on percentage
- Increase or decrease in marks to pass

🔹 8️⃣ Base Value Concept
- Identifying the correct base value in problems
- Choosing original value vs changed value
- Avoiding common base value mistakes in increase/decrease problems

🔹 9️⃣ Reverse Percentage
- If A is x% more than B, then
- B is [x / (100 + x)] × 100 % less than A
- If A is x% less than B, then
- B is [x / (100 − x)] × 100 % more than A
- Commonly asked in comparison and salary problems

🎯 Outcome
Developed strong clarity in percentage formulas and base value concepts.
Gained confidence in solving votes, marks, and reverse percentage problems,
which are frequently asked in placement aptitude rounds.
