## 📘 DSA Practice (Completed) on STRINGS

1️⃣ Remove Outermost Parentheses
Pattern: Greedy + Depth Counter
Single pass traversal
Make a local decision (keep / skip) based on current depth
No backtracking, no extra stack

2️⃣ Reverse Words in a String / Palindrome Check
Pattern:
Word-based string processing
Two Pointer (for palindrome)

3️⃣ Largest Odd Number in a String
Pattern: Greedy + Single Pass
Scan from right to left
First odd digit guarantees the largest possible odd number
Early stopping (greedy choice)

4️⃣ Longest Common Prefix
Pattern: Prefix Scanning / Horizontal Comparison
Compare characters at the same index across all strings
Stop immediately on mismatch
No hashing or frequency counting involved

🧠 Key Learning (Day 7)
Many string problems follow repeatable patterns
Greedy works when decisions are final and irreversible
Prefix problems depend on position, not frequency

--------------------------------------------------------------------DAY-9---------------------------------------
# 📘 Day X – DSA Practice (Strings & Stack Patterns)
Solved the following interview-level problems by **identifying the correct pattern before coding**:

### ✅ Problems Solved

✔ **Sort Characters by Frequency** *(Easy)*  
- **Pattern:** Character Frequency Counting + Sorting  
- **Approach:**  
  - Use HashMap to count character frequencies  
  - Sort characters based on frequency  
- **Key Focus:** Efficient data organization using hashing

✔ **Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses**  
- **Pattern:** Stack / Depth Counter  
- **Approach:**  
  - Traverse string and track current depth  
  - Maintain maximum depth reached  
- **Key Focus:** Understanding balanced parentheses logic

✔ **Roman to Integer**  
- **Pattern:** Symbol Mapping + Greedy Traversal  
- **Approach:**  
  - Map Roman symbols to values  
  - Compare current and next character to decide add/subtract  
- **Key Focus:** Greedy decision-making with mappings

## 🧠 Key DSA Learnings
- String problems require **different thinking models**, not one generic solution  
- Identifying the **right pattern** reduces complexity and bugs  
- Hashing, counters, and greedy logic appear frequently in interviews

📌 This practice is part of a **15-Day Interview Preparation Challenge**  
covering **DSA, Aptitude, and Full-Stack Project Development**.
